# Fluentd/Fluentbit

### How to integrate Fluentd locally

 1. Append this to your `td-agent.conf `.
 2. For the path you will have to create a `log.json` file in the directory and write some sample logs in it.
 3. You can run the command `tail -f /var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`
 4. Make sure the ES Version in `server.yaml` matches the version of ES Fluentd plugin version.

 ```
 <source>
   @type tail
   format json
   read_from_head true
   path /home/username/sigscalr/log.json # this is the path of all log files generated by genevents
   pos_file /var/log/td-agent/httpd-access.log.pos
   tag hyperion
 </source>

 <match hyperion>
   @type elasticsearch
   host localhost
   port 8081
   path /elastic
   <buffer>
     flush_mode interval
     flush_interval 1s  # for test purpose
   </buffer>
 </match>
 ```
