# Open Telemetry

#### MacOS Packaging
- Get the MacOS release using: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fOL https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.80.0/otelcol_0.80.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`
- They are packaged as gzipped tarballs (.tar.gz) and will need to be unpacked with a tool that supports this compression format: `tar -xvf otelcol_0.80.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`.
- Every Collector release includes an otelcol executable that you can run after unpacking.
- Create a config.yaml file which will contain the configurations for the otelCol
- Run otelCol using: `./otelCol --config config.yaml`

The config file used: 
```
