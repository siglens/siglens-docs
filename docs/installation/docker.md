*Installing Siglens using Docker*

If you prefer to use Docker for SigLens installation on your Linux or macOS machine, follow this straightforward "one command" guide. Docker provides a convenient and isolated environment for running SigLens.

Installing SigLens with Docker streamlines deployment, encapsulating all dependencies within a container. This method is user-friendly, ensuring consistent environments and efficient resource usage. It's perfect for those who want a straightforward, hassle-free installation.

## Installing SigLens with Docker

To install SigLens using Docker, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -L https://siglens.com/install.sh | sh
```

The above command will download and run a setup and installation bash script from the Siglens repository which performs the following tasks:

1. **Extracts SigLens Version:** Retrieves the latest SigLens version from the GitHub API.

2. **Checks Sudo Permissions:** Verifies if the script has sudo privileges and prompts the user if needed. 

> You do not need to run the script as root.

3. **Identifies OS and Package Manager:** Determines the operating system and package manager for Docker installation.

4. **Installs Docker and Docker Compose:** Checks for Docker and Docker Compose and installs them if missing.

5. **Starts Docker:** Initiates Docker and checks for a successful start.

6. **Pulls Docker Image for SigLens:** Fetches the SigLens Docker image from the Docker Hub.

7. **Creates Directories and Sets Permissions:** Establishes necessary directories and sets permissions.

8. **Checks and Allocates Ports:** Ensures availability of specified ports (5122 and 8081) and stops conflicting Docker containers.

9. **Sends Sample Log Dataset:** Downloads and sends a sample log dataset to SigLens.

10. **Starts SigLens using Docker Compose:** Launches SigLens via Docker Compose with specified configurations.

## Accessing SigLens UI

Once the installation is complete, you can access the SigLens UI by visiting http://localhost:5122/ in your web browser.

**Note:** Ensure port `5122` is available before running SigLens in a Docker container.
