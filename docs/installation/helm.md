*Installing Siglens using Helm*

This comprehensive guide will help you install SigLens on your local Minikube Kubernetes cluster using Helm. Helm simplifies the deployment of Kubernetes applications, making it a breeze to set up SigLens.

Helm streamlines SigLens deployment on Kubernetes, offering a standardized, scalable, and version-controlled approach. Ideal for Kubernetes users, it simplifies installation as a Kubernetes package, providing templating and packaging for easy configuration and sharing within Kubernetes-native environments.

## Quickstart

This is a quickstart if you are already familiar with the prerequisites and have the setup ready. For a detailed installation guide, refer [Step-by-Step Installation Guide](#step-by-step-installation-guide).

**Install SigLens using Helm**
```
helm repo add siglens-repo https://siglens.github.io/charts
helm repo update
```

**Port forward the ingestion and query server**
```
helm install siglens siglens-repo/siglens
kubectl port-forward svc/siglens-ingest-svc 8081:8081
kubectl port-forward svc/siglens-query-svc 5122:5122
```

Access the SigLens UI at: http://localhost:5122.

## Prerequisites

Before installing SigLens, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

#### Docker:

1. Set up Docker's apt repository.

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install the Docker packages: To install the latest version, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Alternatively, install Docker on Linux by following the official Docker installation guide for your Linux distribution at [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

#### kubectl:
You can install kubectl on Linux using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubectl   # For Debian/Ubuntu
```

Or for other package managers, refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

#### Helm:

**Ubuntu/Debian**

Open a terminal window, Run the following commands to download and install Helm:
   
```bash
curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
echo "deb https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install helm
```

**Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora**
Open a terminal window. Run the following commands to download and install Helm:

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL -o /etc/yum.repos.d/helm.repo https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/rpm/helm.repo
sudo yum install helm
```

</details>

Note: Make sure to check for the latest versions on the respective official websites or package managers. And follow any additional commands as required in the official documentation

### Step 3: Starting Minikube

Now that we have Minikube, kubectl, and Helm installed, let's start our Minikube cluster. In your terminal, enter the following command:

```
minikube start
```

This command initializes Minikube, and it may take a few minutes as it downloads dependencies and sets up the cluster. Once the initialization is complete, you should see output similar to the following:

```
😄  minikube v1.30.1 on Darwin 12.6 (arm64)
✨  Using the docker driver based on existing profile
👍  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
🚜  Pulling base image ...
🏃  Updating the running docker "minikube" container ...
🐳  Preparing Kubernetes v1.26.3 on Docker 23.0.2 ...
🔎  Verifying Kubernetes components...
    ▪ Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5
🌟  Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass
🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default

```

To verify the status of your Minikube cluster, run:

```bash
minikube status
```

You should see a status indicating that the cluster is running.

```bash
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```

> Run `kubectl get nodes` to make sure that the minikube node is up and running.

### Step 4: Adding SigLens Helm Repository

To get started, add the SigLens Helm repository to your Helm configuration:

```bash
helm repo add siglens-repo https://siglens.github.io/charts
```

Update the Helm repository to ensure you have the latest charts:

```bash
helm repo update
```

### Step 5: Installing SigLens
With everything set up, it's time to install SigLens. Use Helm to install the latest version of the SigLens Helm chart:

```bash
helm install siglens siglens-repo/siglens
```

Once the installation is complete, you'll see an output similar to this example:

```bash
NAME: siglens
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jun 16 16:43:51 2023
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
Thank you for installing siglens.
To learn more about the release, try:
  $ helm status siglens
To run tests, try:
  $ helm test siglens
...
```

### Step 6: Accessing SigLens
SigLens is now installed in your local Minikube cluster. To access the SigLens UI, follow these steps:

1. Forward local port 8081 to the ingest service using:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/siglens-ingest-svc 8081:8081
```

2. Get data in SigLens by loading sample data, using our supported ingestion methods, or integrating with your existing tools. Forward local port 8000 to the UI / query service using:
   
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/siglens-query-svc 5122:5122
```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5122 to access the SigLens UI.

### Step 7: Clean Up

Once you've finished working with SigLens, you can stop and delete your Minikube cluster to free up resources, all the configuration files and other data related to the Minikube cluster stored on your system:

- Stop the cluster

```bash
minikube stop
```

- Delete the cluster

```bash
minikube delete
```

Before deleting, it's recommended to stop the cluster using `minikube stop`. Otherwise, the deletion might fail.
