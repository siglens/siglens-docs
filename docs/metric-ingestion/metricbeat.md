# Metricbeat

*Ingesting metrics into Siglens using Metricbeat*

Metricbeat is a lightweight, open-source shipper from Elastic that collects metrics from your systems and services. Metricbeat simplifies the collection and transport of your systems and services metrics.

In this guide, we will walk through the process of using Metricbeat to send metrics to Siglens.

> :warning: **Note:** For Linux Systems, the Metricbeat will not work due to the Go version used in the specific Metricbeat version, which prevents the creation of a new thread on Linux OS. The related issue can be found [here](https://github.com/docker-library/golang/issues/467).

## 1. Install Metricbeat

Download the [`metricbeat-oss-7.9.3`](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/metricbeat-oss-7-9-3) version and extract it to the appropriate directory based on your OS.

### Linux based Systems
Run either of the following commands based on your linx distribution:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i metricbeat-oss-7.9.3-amd64.deb
```
OR

```bash
tar xzvf metricbeat-oss-7.9.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

### Windows
- Download the Zip version, extract the contents into ```C:\Program Files```, rename the directory to Metricbeat, and run the following commands as an Administrator to install Metricbeat as a Windows service:

```bash
PS > cd 'C:\Program Files\Metricbeat'
PS C:\Program Files\Metricbeat> .\install-service-metricbeat.ps1
```

- More details about the installation process can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/7.9/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html)

## 2. Configure Metricbeat

### Sample Configuration

```yaml
metricbeat.modules:
  - module: nginx
    metricsets: ['stubstatus']
    enabled: true
    # The interval in seconds to poll each endpoint.
    period: 10s

    # Nginx hosts
    hosts: ['http://127.0.0.1']

    # Path to server status. Default nginx_status
    server_status_path: 'nginx_status'

output.elasticsearch:
  # Replace with your custom Elasticsearch endpoint
  hosts: ['http://localhost:8081/elastic/']
  index: 'metricbeat-ind-0' # Custom index name

# Disable template management
setup.template.enabled: false

# Disable ilm
setup.ilm.enabled: false
# logging.level: debug
```

## 3. Run Metricbeat

For Linux, navigate to the Metricbeat directory and run 
```bash
sudo metricbeat -e -c /home/metricbeat-config/metricbeat.yaml
```

For Windows, open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator, navigate to `C:\Program Files\Metricbeat`, and run 

```bash
.\metricbeat.exe -e -c D:\Siglens\metricbeat_elasticsearch.yml
```

The `-e` argument is optional and is used for logging.
