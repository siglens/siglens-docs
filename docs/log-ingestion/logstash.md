# Logstash
*Ingesting logs into Siglens using Logstash*

Logstash is an open-source data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite "stash". 

In this guide, we will walk through the process of using Logstash to send logs to Siglens.

## 1. Install Logstash

- Download Logstash-OSS version from [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash-oss) and install using the procedure below
### Linux based Systems

```bash
sudo dpkg -i logstash-oss-7.9.3-amd64.deb
# OR
tar xzvf logstash-oss-7.9.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

### Windows

- Download the Zip version of Logstash, extract its contents into the C drive, rename the directory to "Logstash", then open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator and run the below commands to install Logstash as a Windows service

```bash
PS > cd 'C:\Logstash'
PS C:\Logstash> bin/logstash --version
```

### JVM Options

#### Append at the end of Logstash/config/jvm.options

```options
--add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED

--add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.base/java.security=ALL-UNNAMED
```

## 2. Configure Logstash

- Create a logstash config file with the below [sample configuration](#sample-configuration-file). 
- If you are looking for a sample log dataset you can download it from [here](https://github.com/siglens/pub-datasets/releases/download/v1.0.0/2kevents.json.tar.gz) and untar it.

### Sample Configuration file

```conf
input {
  file {
    path => "D:/Siglens/2kevents.json"
    start_position => "beginning"
  }
}

filter {
  mutate {
    add_field => {
      "index" => "logstash3_splunk_access_logs"
      "source" => "logstash3_source"
    }
  }
  date {
    match => [ "logdate", "ISO8601" ]
    target => "@timestamp"
  }
}

output {
  http {
    format => "json"
    content_type => "application/json"
    http_method => "post"
    url => "http://localhost:8081/splunk/services/collector/event"
    headers => ['Authorization', 'A94A8FE5CCB19BA61C4C08']
  }
}
```

## 3. Run Logstash

- Run `bin/logstash -f <<path-of-logstash-config>>` in the logstash directory (prepend with sudo on Linux, or run as Administrator on Windows).

- ### Linux based systems

  ```bash
  # Assuming the config is in the Logstash directory
  sudo bin/logstash -f ./logstash_config.conf
  ```

- ### Windows

  ```bash
  # Assuming the config is in the Logstash directory
  bin/logstash -f ./logstash_config.conf
  ```
