# Vector
*Ingesting logs into Siglens using Vector*

Vector is a high-performance, open-source observability data pipeline that allows you to collect, transform, and route all your logs and metrics. It's designed to be robust, efficient, and easy to use, making it a popular choice for observability data pipelines.

In this guide, we will walk through the process of using Vector to send logs to Siglens.

## 1. Install Vector
Read more info about installation of Vector from [here](https://vector.dev/docs/setup/installation/).

### For Unix-based Systems

Add the Vector repo:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://setup.vector.dev)"
```

Install using APT (Debian, Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt-get install vector
```
### For macOS

Install using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install vector
```

### For Windows (Using WSL)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://sh.vector.dev | VECTOR_VERSION=0.34.1 bash
```

## 2. Configure Vector

- Make sure that the `endpoints` in the configuration has the `/elastic` suffix.
- If you are looking for a sample log dataset you can download it from [here](https://github.com/siglens/pub-datasets/releases/download/v1.0.0/2kevents.json.tar.gz) and untar it.

## 3. Start Vector

Vector needs to be started with the `--config` argument to specify the path to the configuration file. Run the following command:

```bash
vector --config vector.yaml
