# Saved Queries

Saved Queries is a powerful feature that allows you to save, manage, and reuse your most frequently used or complex queries. This can significantly speed up your workflow by reducing the need to write or copy-paste the same queries over and over again.

For example, if you frequently need to search for all error logs from a specific service over the past 24 hours, you can save this as a Saved Query. Then, instead of manually typing out this query each time, you can simply click on the Saved Query to instantly run it.

In this guide, we will walk through the process of saving, accessing, and managing Saved Queries.
