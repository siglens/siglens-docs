# rare Command

## Description

Displays the least common values within a specified field.

Identifies the rarest combination of values across all fields listed. When a `<by-clause>` is provided, it yields the least common combinations of values for each unique combination of the group-by fields.

This command functions similarly to the `top` command but focuses on identifying the least common values instead of the most common ones.
