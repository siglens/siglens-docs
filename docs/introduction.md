# Introduction

### SigLens is an open source alternative to Splunk/DataDog
<strong>100x</strong> more efficient than Splunk and helps you reduce your observability bill by <strong>90%</strong>

ðŸ‘‰ SigLens is built from scratch to handle terabytes to petabytes of data at a fraction of resources. It is a column-oriented database with dynamic columnar compressions. The dynamic columnar compression algorithm helps achieve 90% compression on various data types including from low to high cardinality data. SigLens invented a microindexing tech that consumes 1/100th size of an actual index but achieves similar functionality as an index. Additionally these microindices are dynamic in nature and adapt to the changing shape of the data. SigLens invented AgileAggsTrees, an innovative approach that helps aggregations queries at lightening speed.
We invite you to try out SigLens. ðŸ‘ˆ
