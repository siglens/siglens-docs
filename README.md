Welcome to the official documentation repository for SigLens, the cutting-edge, open-source alternative to Splunk/DataDog. Our mission is to revolutionize the observability landscape by providing a solution that is not only 100x more efficient than Splunk but also significantly reduces your observability costsâ€”by up to 90%.

This repository is the source of the [Official SigLens documentation](https://siglens.github.io/siglens-docs). We appreciate your interest in contributing and welcome your participation in making this resource even better. If you have any questions, please reach out to us on [Slack](https://www.siglens.com/slack.html).

## Introduction

SigLens is engineered for excellence in managing massive volumes of data, from terabytes to petabytes, without compromising on speed or efficiency. At the heart of SigLens is our proprietary microindexing technology, which ensures that micro indices are only 1/100th the size of traditional indices, resulting in smaller index sizes and faster ingestion speeds. Moreover, SigLens utilizes dynamic columnar compression to reduce on-disk storage size to often just 1% of the incoming volume. This innovation not only enhances query times but also substantially lowers storage and compute requirements.

## Getting Started

**SigLens Platform**: We encourage you to try out SigLens using

- The [SigLens Playground](http://playground.sigscalr.io:5122/), or
- Installing SigLens in your local machine
